This is an introduction to classes in typescript repository for learning purposes only
## Learning
- Adding in constructor public or private infront of arguments makes shorthand initialization

    class Department{
        private employees: string[] = []; 
        private id: string;
        public name: string;

        constructor(id:string, name: string, employees: string[]){
            this.id = id;
            this.employees=employees;
            this.name=name;
        }
    }

equal to 

    class Department{
        constructor(private id:string, public name: string, private employees: string[]){  

        }
    }

- readonly makes the property unchangable once it was initialized (as const does in js)

        class Department {  
            constructor(private readonly id: string, private name: string, private employees: string[]) {
        
        } //when we create an instance of Department we initialize id, and after that, we won't be able to change its value

- <code>protected</code> vs <code>private</code> and <code>public</code><br>
  
    <code>private</code> properties are accessible only inside the class they defined and are not accessible in the class that inherited that class.<br>
    <code>protected</code> is like private, but unlike <code>private</code> they not just available in the class they defined but also in the classes which inherited the class where protected properies defined. If the property is <code>protected</code> it can't be changed from outside of the class it defined, but it can be accessible from the class based on parent class<br>


        class Department {    
            constructor(
                private readonly id: string,
                private name: string,
                protected employees: string[]
            ) {}
            }

        class ITDepartment extends Department {
            constructor(id: string, employees: string[], public admins: string[]) {
            super(id, 'IT', employees); //hardcoding the name because ITDepatment class
        }
            addAdmin(employee: string) {
                if(!this.employees.find(person=> person === employee)){ //this.employees is available because it is protected, not private
                this.addEmployee(employee);
                }
                this.admins.push(employee);
            }
        }
    access:<br>
    <code>private</code> for internal access<br> 
    <code>protected</code> access for internal and inherited classes<br>
    <code>public</code> access from everywhere<br>


- get and set in class we access like a property, without ()


        accountingDepartment.mostRecentReport='Report 2022'; //set
        const recentReport = accountingDepartment.mostRecentReport;//get returns value

- <code>abstract</code> keyword allows to add to super class a method that we don't provide a logic/value in super class. It instructs that every class that inherits this super class(based on super class) should have this methods and should add its own logic to it. Abstract methods can only appear within an abstract class.

        abstract class Department {
            abstract describe(this: Department): void;
        }

    Classes marked as <code>abstract</code> can't be instancieted. It is just a class to inherit from and forse classes which iherits it to have properties and methods marked as <code>abstract</code>.
    
        const department1= new Department();//ERROR 

- <code>static</code> methods we can call directly on a class, not on an object created based on it. (Math.random() is an example of static method)
- A singleton class is configured such that you don't create it with "new" but by calling a method which then ensures that only one instance of the class exists at any given time. (private consturtor and implemented logic to check instances)
